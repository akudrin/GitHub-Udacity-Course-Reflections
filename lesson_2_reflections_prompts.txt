How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

As a result of using diff command to compare two files I was able to distinguish 
content of two files. The sign - showed what was written in the old file and the sign +
showed me what changes where made or what text was added to the new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

I could trace mistakes I made or I will be able to see how my code has improved 
with time. Also I could reverse changes I made and start all over again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

When you are manually choose when to make a commit you have better control over your code.
You can save anytime you think it is right to do so. On the other hand when you have
versions automatically saved you can do a lot of changes without any commits which is bad. 
Though when you manually commit you can forget to make a commit while Google Docs will make
a commit automatically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in 
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git was made more for coding where you might have several files all related to each
other (so changes made in one file will affect another file). Google Docs is made to track
changes in one file like word document, excel etc.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

By using git log command I can find a commit and its name. Once I have found the commit I was
looking for by using git diff command I can compare this commit with the next one to see 
what changes have been done.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could 
break something?

I can revert those changes back and trace bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To make changes in the file then commit them and see in which HEAD I am.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new folder .git is made which has metadata to track changes. Otherwise
its just a folder with some files in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers? 

Working directory has all files you are working on. Repository shows all commits made by the
user. Its a good idea to keep commits small with one commit per logical change. Git makes
it easier to do this by allowing you to specify exactly what changes should be committed.
Instead of doing git commit to the whole directory staging area allows to add one file
at a time to it. Then when I am ready to commit I can bundle all files in the staging area
to be committed to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I should have only those files on the staging area making changes in which will 
represent one logical change. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

By making branches it is possible to add some experimental features to your program. The 
main code stays the same you only making changes in the branch. The main "master" branch
always works and your other branches are development branches where you make/add/change
features.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can trace the history of commits and see different branches. I can also understand
reachability of commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent 
it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is that two codes a merged into one. Git can see what changes have been made and
adds them together when merging. 

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Pros: you have better control so when logical change is done you can merge. Cons: you 
can forget to merge and loose some functionality.
