When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code with other people or I want other people to amend/work on 
my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Again here I can control what I am doing and update repositories when logical changes 
were done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

Forks are made on GitHub from other repositories. They are copies of other people's 
repositories. Changes made in a fork do not affect the repository from which the fork
was made. The reason behind fork is that you are not allowed to change someones repository
but you want to make changes so you fork the whole project to your account and leave 
a link to original repository so the viewers can trace the original maker of the code. 
Branches are made on your repository to add new functionality to your project. Clones are 
made to copy two repositories locally on your PC or from GitHub to your PC. Clones do not leave
traces of who wrote the original code unless you specify.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

You can see what changes have been done and compare two versions. You can also work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using emails, shared server, dropbox or other file storage services to share files between
each other. It will complicate the whole process as different versions of files can be easily
lost, deleted or corrupted. Using these services for small jobs is easier but in reality on more
complex projects it is better to use Git. Also GitHub provides ready made platform to communicate
with other people/team members.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?  

When I want to have someones opinion about my code. It will allow him to review my changes
before I will make a commit.
